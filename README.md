#A portfolio website is a personal static website created to represent a student’s academic background, technical skills, projects, and basic personal information in a professional manner. As a Master’s degree student in Computer Science, creating a portfolio website is an important step toward learning web development fundamentals and showcasing skills to internship providers and future employers. This portfolio website is developed as part of an internship task using basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is static in nature, which means the content remains the same for all users and does not require a database or server-side programming.
The main purpose of this portfolio website is to provide a simple and clear introduction about the student, including educational background, skills, projects, and contact information. The website consists of different sections such as header, about me, skills, projects, and contact details. Each section is designed in a clean and readable manner so that anyone visiting the website can easily understand the student’s profile. This portfolio acts as a digital resume and helps in building an online presence.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create the basic structure of the website. It defines the content of the webpage such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and sections. In this project, HTML is used to create different sections like the header for the student’s name, an about section to describe personal and academic details, a skills section to list technical abilities, and a contact section for communication details. HTML provides the foundation on which the entire website is built.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to design and style the website. It controls the appearance of the webpage, including colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, and layout. CSS is used to make the website visually attractive and easy to read. It also helps in creating a responsive design, which means the website adjusts properly on different screen sizes such as mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. Basic CSS properties like background color, font size, margin, padding, and media queries are used in this project to improve the overall look and usability of the website.
JavaScript is used to add basic interactivity and functionality to the website. Although this is a static website, JavaScript helps in enhancing user experience by handling simple actions such as displaying messages in the console or adding small dynamic behavior. In this portfolio project, JavaScript is used in a simple way to show that the student understands the basics of scripting and client-side logic.
The development of this portfolio website is done using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which is a popular and beginner-friendly code editor. VS Code provides useful features such as syntax highlighting, extensions, and an integrated terminal that make coding easier and more organized. The Live Server extension in VS Code is used to run and preview the website in a web browser in real time while making changes.
Git and GitHub are used for version control and project storage. Git helps in tracking changes made to the project files, while GitHub is used to store the project in an online repository. All files related to the portfolio website, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, are uploaded to GitHub. This allows the project to be shared easily and also demonstrates the student’s understanding of basic version control concepts, which are essential in software development.#
Overall, this portfolio website project helps in understanding the fundamentals of web development, improves practical coding skills, and builds confidence in using modern development tools. It serves as a strong foundation for advanced web technologies and is a valuable addition to a Master’s degree student’s academic and professional profile.
